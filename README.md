This is built with elm. You'll need to install the elm toolchain to
build it.

https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html

Then you can just use `make` to build the site.

The `genlink` script will generate a link and a URL query string you can
use with the web app to pass in a challenge message.

If hosting online, once the site has been built, only the contents of
the `site` directory need to be uploaded.
